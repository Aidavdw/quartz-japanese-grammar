means '*for the first time in (...)*' whe put with a #counter . 
Very rarely used in kanji form 振り[[に]]
It is usually only used for longer duration of time (time > O(hours)) 

>==３年ぶりに==風呂に入る。
>I bathed ==for the first time in 3 years==.

The very common 久しぶり is one specific case of this!
>久し{{c1::ぶりに}}ですね。
>It's been a while, hasn't it? 
>(lit.) This is ==the first time in a while==, isn't it?

に can become の if it directly modifies a noun.  
>４年==ぶりの==寿司だ！やっぱり日本の寿司はうまいな！
>This is my ==this-4-year's first== sushi!
