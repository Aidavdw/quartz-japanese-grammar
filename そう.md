used as そうだ, it is [[Auxiliary verb]]. Apparently not just copula.
tl:dr;
unaltered/unconjugated or だそうだ → hearsay, information repeated from someone else
conjugated → it seems that (...)

[[そうだ vs らしい vs みたい vs ようだ vs なんだって]]
# seems (...)
The broad meaning in each of its applications is that something 'seems' to be a certain way.
It implies **low confidence**
This conjugates with verbs, 形容詞. In 形容動詞, no だ is added.

It can be used with a verb conjugation after the stem
>あの建物は==崩れそうだ==
>**It looks like** that building **is about** to collapse.

>彼は病気に==なりそうだ==
>**He looks like** he will become sick.

>彼女は毎日==走りそうだ==。
>She ==looks like== she runs every day.

Also with #形容動詞＋
>あの店員は丁寧==そうだ==。
>The clerk appears to be polite.

>電話はとても==便利そうだ==。
>Phones seem super convenient!

It can be used with a #形容詞〜  . Note that the extra い disappears!
>これは==正しそうだ==
>This appears to be correct.

>==楽しそう==です
>Fun-looking

>このケーキは==美味しそうじゃありません==
>This cake doesn't look yummy at all...

# Negative: なさそう
When negative, it has a special conjugation 〜なさそう. This is due to the ない that is used with negative verbs being an auxiliary verb, and not an い-Adjective.
>彼の部屋は==汚くなさそうだ==。
>His room **doesn't seem** messy

>あの車は小さくて便利じゃなさそう。
>That car is too small, and it **doesn't seem** convenient.

This is NOT the case for verbs
>彼はもうイギリスに==帰らな==~~さ~~==そうだ==。
## Negative: そうにもない
Other negative is a Common sentence pattern too: そうにもない is the negative version of 「〇〇そうだ。」, used to denote that something 'doesn't look like it is (...)', or 'does not look to be (...)'
>雨が==降りそうにもない==。
>**It doesn't look like** it will rain

# Hearsay
[[Hearsay]] information repeated from someone else, or making a presumption
No conjugation, just add そうだ to the end.

for #verb＋ 
>あの建物は**崩れた**==そうだ==
>**I heard that** the building has collapsed.

>彼女は毎日走る==そうだ==。
>**Rumour has it that** she she runs every day.

#形容動詞＋, an extra だ needs to be added.
>あの店員は丁寧==だそうだ==。
>**I've heard that** the clerk is polite.

Unlike the 'seems-like' interpretation, hearsay can also go #noun＋ .
>先輩は明日も仕事==だそうだ==
>**I've heard that** senpai will be working tomorrow as well...

Sometimes it is combined with some variation of [[言う]] to denote who said it.
==彼が言うには==、 明日学校は==休みだそうです==。
According to him, apparently tomorrow is a day off for school.

Also with 話[[で#Method or means]]
>先生の==話では==、田中さんは==体調が悪いそう==です。
>Sensei said that Tanaka-san's health is bad.
