gives a nuance of 'ought to', 'supposed to be' or 'should' to sentences, implying high probability.  
「はずなのに」is derived from this!
very rarely in kanji, 筈

>これは==食べられるはずだ==。
>This should be edible

For #形容動詞＋ , keep the [[な。]]
>図書館は==静かなはずです==
>Libraries ought to be quiet.

For #noun＋, add a [[の]].
>今日、会社は==休みのはずだ==
>**I'm pretty sure** today is a day off for the company.

Very common set expression is はずなのに, coming from はず＋[[のに#Despite]]
>==同じはずなのに==、違う。
>It should have been the same, but it was different.

>==来る筈なのに==来ない
>He was supposed to come, but he didn't.
