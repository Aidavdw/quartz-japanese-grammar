Generally means that 

# なのに
Like all の, needs a な for nouns.
>バカ~~だの~~に  
>バカ==なのに==
>He's such a fool... (complaint)
# In order to (...)
>[!from] [[の#Single instance of performing an action]] + [[に#into (...)]] 

as in "to do the action of (...)"
>==話すのに==Lineを使おうか？
>Wanna **use** line **to chat**?

# The opposite of what you expected
States that something is unlike what you expected. Similar to けど, but the nuance is more on it being a little disappointing.
It is also not used with feelings, requests and commands
## Despite
Note that it derives form [[explanatory の・んだ]], and hence must go with a な when #noun＋ !
>==毎日運動したのに==、全然軽くなった
>**Despite** exercising daily, I did not get thinner.

>ご飯を==食べたのに==すぐお腹がすきます。
>Even though I ate, my stomach felt empty right away.

>==風邪なのに==働く
>To work **despite of a cold.**

>==安いのに==とても美味しいです。
>**despite being cheap**, it's delicious.

## Complaint or surprise
it also has an edge of it being a complaint, just generally expressing something was unexpected.. When the actual reason is omitted, it can be just as a #sentence-ending , and it just becomes like a :(

>疲れている==のに==。
>I'm tired.

>風邪な==のに==。
>I have a cold :(

>安い==のに==。
>wtf it's so cheap!

## Regret that something didn't happen
expresses a slight annoyance or regret that something should take place, while it hasn't or won't.  
>[!form]
> [[〜ば]] + のに

俺に力が==あれば==、フリアエを守れる==のに==。
>**If only** you were powerful, y**ou would have been able to** protect Furiae (from drakengard)

>あの時、頑張って彼女に好きって==言えば==よかった==のに==。
>Back then, **If only** I had tried my best and told that girl I liked her (it would have been better).

It's more emotional and less polite than ばよかった
>こんな日が**続けば良かった**...
>It would be nice if days like this could last forever...
>こんな日が==続けば==良い==のに==...
>Why can't days like this last forever, aaaa
