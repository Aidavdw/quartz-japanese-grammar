is the [[連用中止法 (i-stem)]] of ない, the [[negative form (〜ない)]] of [[ある]]
'without' or 'un-', but still nominalising the noun.  
It's an old form, that has been largely replaced by ない.  

Note that it can be attached to nouns directly:
>==酸素無し==では 生きていけない。
>You can't live **without** oxygen

>==休日なし==で働く
>Working **without** taking a holiday.

>砂糖なしケーキ
>A cake **without** sugar.

>==話したりも無し==に休まれては困るね。
>To be stressed because someone took a day off **without** even telling you.
