# Concurrently doing actions
When used #verb〜 , it denotes you do action A while at the same time doing action B.
Simultaneous actions are different from parallel actions: each action is done by the same subject here, instead of by different ones.  
Parallel: “I will eat rice and my mother will eat bread.”  
Simultaneous: "I’m eating rice **while I'm also** eating bread."

>I apologised while crying.

>いつも、音楽を==聞きながら==勉強しています。
>To always study **while** listening to music.

This can not be used if the action only takes a very short time. in such a case, use the [[〜て]] form instead.
