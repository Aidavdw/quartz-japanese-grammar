# Every/each (day, month, ...) (まい)
when used as {毎|まい}, it denotes you do something every when (...).

>==毎朝==散歩に出かけます。
>Every morning, I go out for a walk.

>==毎日==どこでご飯を食べますか。
>Where do you eat every day?

It can only be used with days, months, etc
>~~毎アニメ~~を見よう
>~~毎旅~~に料理する

adding の[[よう (様)|よう]]に shows that it **almost** always happens.
>==毎日のように==ポテトチップス食べてるから太ってきた。
>Because I eat potato chips almost every day, I am getting fat.

>渋谷のmeetupは==毎週のように==行っているよ。
>I go to the shibuya meetups almost every week.

## Set expressions
Other than the temporal repetitions, some generalising set expressions exist.
Set expressions are: 毎度、毎回、（very formal　{毎次|まいじ}）

>==毎回==参加します
>I participate **every time**.

>==毎次=={密接|みっせつ}に連絡を取ります
>I'll be in close touch **each time**.
# Whenever, with each (...) (ごとに)
Written as {毎|ごと}に.
Should not be confused with [[With (...) attached to]]
Its use is on the decline (rarer than まい), as it is a bit old-fashioned.
## (...) occurs every time when (...)
For every constant A (place, point of time, or person), a repetition B occurs.
>彼は==週毎に==４万円の稼ぎがあります
>He has earnings of 40 000 yen a week.

>==旅ごとに==料理する
>Every time I travel, I cook.
## there is a different (...) for every
For every variable A (place/person), a different thing exists.
>==歌手毎に==、独創的な声があります。
>**Every singer** has a **different**, distinctive voice.
## Every nth
Every *nth* repetition, something happens.
This means that the repetition itself is also counted! This is different from [[おきに#Every other nth]]
>==四年ごとに==、オリンピックが開かれる。
>Every four years, the Olympics are held (3 years without, then a year with games.)
>🥇○🥇○🥇○🥇…

it can also be used for distance. It then implies going from the midpoint.
>==5メートルごとに==瓶を載せる。
>To put down a bottle every 5 meters

## Each time (...), it becomes more (...)
As you repeat a certain constant A, a change progresses. (Rarely seen with verbs)  
>==一雨ごとに==、もっと暖かくなる。
>Whenever there is rain, it gets warmer.
