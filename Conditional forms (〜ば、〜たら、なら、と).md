# 一言で言うと
- [[と]]: 100 certain. ***when** X happens, Y happens*, so more like 'when' than 'if'
- [[なら(ば)]]: “**if you are talking about…, then…**“, used to give **suggestions or advice, speculation, or requests** .
- [[〜たら]]: It implies a sequence: something happens after something else happens. 80% certain.
- [[〜ば]]: denotes requirement: *A is only (...) if B is (...)*. requires volition. Emphasises the future.

# 例文
>それ==なら==、簡単だ！
>Oh, if that's the case, it must be easy! (e.g. receiving instructions on how to replace a battery. The listener extrapolates information that they heard, and conclude that it must be easy.)

>それ==だと==、簡単だ。
>When that is the case, it is easy (e.g. describing different ways to solve differential equations. It is certain that if that is the case, finding the solution is easy.)

>其れ==だったら==、簡単だ。
>If that has happened, it will be easy. (e.g. after you have installed the software, using it is easy.)

>其れ==であれば==、簡単だ。
>If you get there, it will be easy. (e.g. telling you that, in the future, when you are older, you will understand.)

>まあ、無理==であれば==、月曜日までに出してください。
>まあ、無理==なら==、月曜日までに出してください。

黒いスーツを着{{c1::たらどうですか}}？

# 〜ば with double actions
>京都へ~~来れば~~、ぜひ連絡してください。
>京都へ==来たら==、ぜひ連絡してください。
>After you have arrived in Tokyo, please contact me!

If the subject for both sub-sentences is the same, you cannot use the ～ば form.  
>私は~~飲めば~~運転しないで。
>私は==飲んだら==運転しないで。
>**If** you drink, don't drive

Here, 飲めば would be wrong, because the subject of 飲む and 運転 is the same.
