a [[Particle]]
# Nominalise sub-sentence
>昨日何を食べた==か==忘れた
>I forgot **what** I ate yesterday (_I forgot about "what did I eat yesterday?"_).

>彼は何を言った==か==分からない
>I don't understand **what** he said (_I don't understand about "what is he talking about?"_).

>結婚しよう==か==と思っている
>I am thinking **about** getting married

Also works with [[Question word]]. Often particles disappear.
>==どこか==遠くに行く
>Going **somewhere** far away

>この文章は==何か==が可笑しい
>As for this sentence, **something** is wrong with it.

>==いつか==日本語に行きます
>I'll go to japan **someday**

# Or
can denote 'A **or** B', as a summation.
>京都==か==東京に行く
>Going to Kyoto **or** Tokyo

# か...か
A combination of first a [[か#Or]] and then a [[か#Nominalise sub-sentence]]. Good exercise!
>死ぬ==か==生き==か==ということだ
>It's a matter of living or dying.

>やる==か==やらない==か==早く決めてください。
>Whether you will do it or not do it, decide it quickly.

Combined with a question word and its [[Question word#Nominalisation]] is basically the same thing.
>明日は==雨かどうか==分からない。
>Whether it will rain tomorrow or whatever, I don't know.

# Question marker
Denotes a question. Note that this is mostly for #formal speech, using it in casual makes it sound a bit forceful.
>どう思います==か==？
>どうおもう~~か~~？
>What do you think?
