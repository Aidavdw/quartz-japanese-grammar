All represent some sort of limit or restriction (限定).

きり puts more emphasis than だけ (強調). It is more used to show e.g. "all alone, 
:( "
>△　クリスマスは==一人だけ==で過ごす。
>○　クリスマスは==一人きり==で過ごす。　(emphasis)
>To spend christmas alone

[[だけ]] is the antonym of [[しか]], but as しか can only be used in the negative, they are used similarly.
Making だけ negative as well shows they are quite different however:

>魚==だけ==食べ==なかった==
>I **only** did not eat fish (I ate anything else)

>魚==しか==食べ==なかった==
>I did not eat **anything but** fish (I ate nothing else)

[[きり]]
