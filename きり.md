It is the [[連用中止法 (i-stem)]] version of  [[切る]].
# Since doing (...)
〇〇してその後ずっと〇〇していない。
after [[〜た]] #verb＋ , きり is primarily used to show that some time has passed since performing some action, and you have not done it since.
In almost every situation, (A) is something that has only happened once, and きり can be interpreted as 'ever since'.
>晩ご飯==食べたきり==何も食べてないから、めちゃお腹が空いた。
>**Since eating** dinner, I have not eating anything. therefore, my stomach is super empty.

>10ヶ月前に==日本に出たきり==、帰国していない.
>**Since leaving japan** 10 months ago, he has not returned to his home country.

>==卒業したきり==、会ってない。
>Since graduating, we haven't met.
# Only (...)
similar to だけ, but putting more emphasis.
Also with #noun＋  and #counter it can mean 'only'.
>==一人き==りになれる時間が欲しい。
>I want some time for **myself alone**.

>彼とは==一度きり==しか会えていない。
>I was only able to meet him once.

[[だけ vs しか vs ぎり vs のみ]]
# Only doing (...)
他のことをしないで、〜たけしている
A combination of the "only" and the "since" meaning.
寝たきり is a very often used expression.

>お祖母ちゃんは去年病気で倒れて、==寝たきり==になった。
>**Since** grandma fell sick last year, and she became bedridden (**can only lie in bed)

>階段で転んで、==寝たきり==になってしまった
>**Since** falling from the stairs, **the only thing I have been able to do was lie in bed**.

>夫が入院したので、==つきっきり==で{看病|かんびょう}した。
>When my husband was in the hospital, **the only thing I did** was take care of him (I did nothing else).

>赤ちゃんのお世話に==かかりっきり==で、掃除も洗濯もできない
>**All I have been doing was** taking care of the baby, so I have not been able to do laundry or cleaning.
# Casual
っきり is the #casual variant of きり.
 >ふたりっきりですね。
 > It's just the two of us, isn't it?
