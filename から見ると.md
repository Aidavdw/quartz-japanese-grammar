[[にとって vs から言うと vs から見るとvs からすると]]
## Point of view
When people are used in **A**, they are often preceded by a sentence that narrows down their position: 「～の私から見ると」「～な私から見ると」「～である私から見ると」(all means “from my point of view as being …”).

> 元警察官の私==から見ると==、彼女が嘘をついているのはバレバレだ。
>**From my perspective as a** former police officer, it is obvious that she is lying

> お客さん==から見ると==、うちの店長は良い人に見えるだろう。
> **From** the customer **'s point of view**, our store manager would appear to be a good person.
## Concluding something
This is only for visual information
> 凶器の状態==から見て==、殺人事件に違いない
> **Seeing from** the state of the murder weapon, it **(can be concluded that)** it is a murder case.

> 彼のお金の使い方==から見ると==、宝くじが当たったんだと思う。
> **from the** way he spends his money, **(it can be concluded that)** I think he won the lottery

*The speaker saw how he spent his money (a part of him) and guessed that he had won the lottery.*
