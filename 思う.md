# To think
With normal sentence + [[と]]思う = "is what I think"
>綺麗だ==と思う==。
>I think it's pretty.

# Intention to (...), thinking about doing (...)
When with the [[volitional form (〜oう)]], shows that you have an intention to do something.
>行==こうと思います==。
>I think I'll go.

Sometimes abbreviated, removing the actual 思う. Has a very spontaneous vibe to it.
>靴を==履こっと==
>I think I'll wear shoes!

>買おうと！
>I think I'll buy it!

Combined with [[〜ている]], denotes that it's an ongoing process. You haven't fully made up your mind yet.
>北海道へ==行こうと思っています==。
>Im thinking about going to Hokkaido

Don't confuse this with ように + 思う
