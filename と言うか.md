When adding a[[と言う]] + [[か#Nominalise sub-sentence]], the 'thing just said/thing called' is nominalised as expected, but the meaning becomes more akin to **"it would be more accurate to say that (...)"**
it adds a questioning element to a sentence. It's pretty #casual .

>お酒は好き==というか==、ないと生きていけない
>I like alcohol, **or rather it'd be more accurate to say that**, if it didnt exist, I couldn't live.

It can also be used stand-alone at the start of a sentence.
>多分行かないと思う。==と言うか==、お金がないから、行けない。
>I probably won't go. **or more accurately**, because I don't have money, I won't go.

>==と言うか==、もう帰らないとだめですけど。
>**Actually**, I must go home already.
