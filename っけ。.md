is like [[ね。]], but implies you really aren't so sure anymore, looking for verification.  
It should only be used after a [[copula (だ・です)]] or a [[〜た|Past tense]]; explanatory んだ is fine too.

>誕生日は三月==だっけ。==
>Your birthday was in march, **right? (What was it again?)**

>レポートの提出は君が遣ってる==んだっけ==？
>as for the submitting of the report, you are doing it **right? (What was it again?)**

>で、どこ==だっけ==
>eh, where was it again?
