# 依る
This word has implies going from one condition to another in a flowing, smooth manner. Hence, it has two main uses "to be due to, to be caused by" and "coming from X, it is so that Y."
## Source of information.  
When combined with [[と]] (I think the conditional/contrast marker).
"coming from X, it is so that Y."
Often used with some sort of [[Hearsay]] modifier like [[そう]] to denote that it's not entirely sure, because you heard it from there.

>==ホームページによると==、それはとても簡単だ==そうだ==
>**According to** the webpage, it is really easy.

>==天気予報に依ると==、今日は雨だ==そうだ==。
>**Based on the weather report**, it appears that today will be rainy.

>友達の==話によると==、彼女はやっとボーイフレンドを==見つけたらしい==。
>According to my friend's story, she has finally found a boyfriend!

によれば, from [[〜ば]], has exactly the same meaning, but the difference in certainty between [[と]] and [[〜ば]] still exists.
>==目撃者によれば==、犯人は20代男性だ。
>According to the eyewitness, the perpetrator is a male in his 20's.

### ところに依ると
It is specific to use #verb＋ , and requires coupling with something denoting [[Hearsay]]
is a specific way to show a source of information: Not just where you have it from, but also how it was conveyed. Really awkward to transliterate.
>==先生に聞いたところによると==、来週からオンライン授業になる==らしい==よ。
>**I heard from my teacher** that it seems that we'll be doing online classes from next week onwards.

>==天気予報で見たところによると==、明日は暑い==らしい==
>From what I saw on the weather report, it seems tomorrow will be hot.

>==ニュースで聞いたところによると==、大きな台風が上陸する==ということだ==
>I heard on the news that a a big typhoon is coming up.

>==先生が言うところによると==、彼女は満点でN１に合格したそうだ
>Teacher said that she passed N1 with a full 100% score.

## Depending on (different per)
also comes from 依る, but now more like "it flows out of the context".
>==人によって==話が違う。
>**Depending on who you ask**, the story will be different. 

>==季節によって==果物は美味しいくなったり、まずくなったりする。
>**Depending on the season**, the fruit is either tasty or bad-tasting.

Ambivalent example:
>それは、==彼女による==ね。
>That is what she says, yeah
>That depends on her
# に因る - because of
denotes that something is caused by something else.  
it is a different flavour of よる, coming from {因|よ}る.  
>このミスは==勘違いによる==ものです。
>This mistake was **because of a misunderstanding**.

>この==地震による==津波の心配はありません。
>You don't have to worry about a tsunami **caused by the earthquake**.

# 由る - by (means of )
denotes that something implies the use of something else
おじさんは==盗賊による==、命を{奪|うば}われた。
Uncle had his life taken away** by a burglar**

>==力によって==決断する
>To settle it **by using force**.

>==カーテンによって=={仕切|しき}ったところが僕の部屋だ。
>The place that is divided up **with the use of curtains** is my room.

## Made by me
When used with the [[passive form (〜aれる)#Adversarial passive]], describes that something has been created by someone. Not super common.
>この歌は==私によって書かれた==
>This song was written by me.
