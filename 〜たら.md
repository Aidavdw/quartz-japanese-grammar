The most common way of saying 'if'.
more accurately [[〜た|Past tense]] + ら, as ==〜なかったら== etc. are also valid.
It is most close to [[と#Conditional]].
It implies a sequence: something happens after something else happens.
Often proceeded by [[もし]]. 
# When conditions are met, something happens
Not a hypothetical, because you are pretty sure it will actually happen.
>会議が==終わったら==、電話しますね。
>I will call you **when** the meeting is over.

>金持になったら、城を買う！
>If I ever get rich, I will buy a castle! (you are sure you will some day get rich)

>もし雨が==降らなかったら==、行きましょう。
>If it doesn't rain, let's go!

>雨が降り==やんだら==、どこかに行くと決めた。
>We have decided to go somewhere **when** it stops raining. (It'll have to stop raining at some point right?)

# something happened after an action.
Just like a sequence!
often unexpected, but not always.
Not really an 'if', more a 'when', 'upon (...)' or even 'after (...)'.
>ドアを==開けたら==、サンタさんが立っていました。
>**When** I opened the door, Santa was standing there.

>==休んだら==、元気になった。
>**When** I rested, I got better.

>本を==読んであげたら==、弟が喜びました。
>**After** I read a book for him, my little brother is very happy.

>家に==帰ったら==、誰もいなかった
>When i returned home, there was nobody there. (I was expecting someone to be there)

# Natural consequence
Note that it is less certain than [[と]].
>風邪を==引いたら==、くしゃみが出でます。
>If you catch a cold, you'll (most likely) sneeze.

>人を==殺したら==、{死刑|しけい}になります
>If you kill a person, you'll (most likely) receive the death penalty.

# Emphasising a topic
Most close to [[なら(ば)]], as it emphasises the 'if it is (...) we are talking about, (...)'. Here it loses all function of a conditional though, essentially being like は.
>お父さん==だったら==部屋にいるよ。
>If it is dad we are talking about, he is in the room.

# Asking for Advice
very common expression 「～たら [[良い]]ですか？」, lit. *if I were to do (...), would it be(come) good?*.
>何を==着たらいいですか==？
>What should I wear?

# 〜ましたら is a little unnatural
It is gramatically correct, but not very often used.
>読んだら　○
>読みましたら　△
