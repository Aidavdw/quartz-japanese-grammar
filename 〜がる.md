〜がる has to do with expressing emotions, making it clear how one feels.
It is a [[五段]] [[Auxiliary verb]]. It goes with a limited set of adjectives ([[〜がる#List of words that can go with がる]]).
It has special cases for [[〜がり]] and [[〜がり屋]]
# Main interpretations
it has 2 main uses:
## Expressing emotion (very clearly) to the outside world
One use is if the subject really expresses some emotion to the outside world, or they are making it extremely clear.
> アイダは日本での生活を==懐かしがっています==。
> Aida misses her time of living of japan (she's **really acting like it, making it very obvious**).
## Positively stating someone else's emotions
You cannot use the positive form to state someone else's emotions. Using 〜がる does allow for this.
One way this can be interpreted is by comparing it to the first rule: You cannot positively state someone else's emotions directly, because you do not know how they feel. You can say that the look like they are having an emotion though, but only know if they making it clear externally. 

>闇が怖い
>I am afraid of the dark

>子供も大人も暗闇**を**~~怖い~~のはとても一般的です
>子供も大人も暗闇**を**==怖がる==のはとても一般的です
>it is common for both adults and children to be afraid of the deep dark **(they appear to be afraid)**

Note that no such rule about not being able to state someone's emotion for anything that's not a positive though. The following sentence is valid:
> 狼が**怖くない**けれど
> Wolves are not afraid, however.
## Standing out (from from crowd)
The speaker is having themselves stand out from everyone around them.
> 俺おれだけが==面白がっていた==のか？
> **Am I the only one** who thought it was amusing?
# Nuances
### Feelings do not have to be as expected
The internal state and perceived state of the subject of a ～がる **do not have to** match. The feelings can be uncharacteristic, or contrast what we know/think of them. Normal is also fine though.
>彼は何も言わなかったが、心の中では=={悔|くや}しがっていた==。
>He did not say anything **(he looked alright with it) but**, deep inside **he was very disappointed**.
## Eyeroll
がる sometimes alludes to a bit of  a critical tone, bit of a 'pfffft look at this guy'. This is on top of the two main meanings.
>あの{小僧|こぞう}、2匹めで色違いのポケモンが出て==嬉しがっていた==。
>**pfft**, that little prat, being all pleased when the second pokemon that came out was a shiny.

>誰でも神を==信じたがります==。
>Everyone wants to believe in god ***(what fools they are, the speaker thinks)***
## Grouchy
When used with negative emotions, the speaker sounds grumpy.
> 私は今苦しがっています。
> I'm suffering (in case you didn't know)

>私は子供のころ、歯医者に行くのを==嫌がっていました==。
>When I was a kid, I hated it when I went to a dentist.


# Transitivity
〜がる is generally intransitive, but if a こと・の is added it can be transitive.
>お父さんに会ったけど、すごく==寂しがっていた==よ。
>I met my dad, but he seemed really lonely. (intr.)

>彼は東京に帰れない==**ことを**悲しがっていた==。
>He seemed **sad about** not being able to return Tokyo. (trans.)
