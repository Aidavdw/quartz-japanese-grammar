# as adjective
to turn a 形容詞 into an adjective, just make い→く
>==強く==叩く
>To strike someone strongly

# [[negative form (〜ない)]] is also a 形容詞
And hence follows the same rules
>子供は==泣かなく==なる
>Children become non-criers; Children don't cry anymore

>ケーキを==食べなくな==りました
> It has become so that I don't eat cake ; I don't eat cake anymore

# with [[する]]・[[なる]]
indicate something **changing/becoming** an **い-adjective**, you conjugate it as ==〜く==.  
Note that no extra に is necessary, also when used with なる.

>涼し==くなった==
>It has become cool

>値段を==安くした==
>I made the price cheap.

>去年から背が==高くなった==ね
>You have grown since last year, haven't you?
