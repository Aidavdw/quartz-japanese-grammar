The difference between summing with し and て for states is that:  

[[〜て]] implies it's just these things

>優し==くて==、良==くて==、面白いから。
>It's because he's gentle, nice, and interesting (**and no other things**)

>お金も==なくて==、時間もない。  
>I don't have money, **and** I don't have time.

[[〜し]] implies there may be **other things too**
>優し==いし==、良==いし==、面白いから。
>It's because he's gentle, nice, and interesting (**and potentially other things too**)

>お金も==ないし==、時間もない。  
>**not only** do I not have money, I **also** don't have time.

[[〜たり]]
>お金も==なかったり==、時間もな==かったり==する。  
>I don't have time, money, **or something else**.
