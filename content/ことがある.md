# There are times when I do (...)
Denotes that 'there are times/cases when (...)': it is **occasionally** so.
>一人で夜に散歩する==ことがある==。
>**There are times when** I go for an evening stroll by myself.

>日本語を話せるが、簡単な言葉の意味を忘れる==ことがある==      。
>I can speak japanese, but **there are times when** I forget the meaning of simple words.

>少しも眠れない==ことがある==
>**There are times when** I am not able to get even a little sleep.

Putting the ある in the past tense emphasises that there were times when you did something (but you no longer do them).
>眠る==ことがあった==
>I used to sleep (there have been times when I was sleeping)

>聞く==ことがあった==
>There have been times where I listened.

# 形容詞 and 形容動詞
It can also go with #形容詞＋ or #形容動詞＋ if given extra な.
>飛行機の中は、==臭いことがある==。
>The inside of an aeroplane is **sometimes** smelly.

>公園は、==静かなことがある==。
>**Sometimes**, the park is quiet.

# With も
It can also be combined with [[も]] to denote contrast
>日本語の文法は、==面白いこともある==。
>**There are even times when** japanese grammar is interesting (normally it is boring.)

Or just 'also'
>==割れていることもある==から、いつも中身をチェックする。
>**It also occasionally happens that** it is broken, so I always check the inside.
# Noun
To attach it to a noun, you need to attach an extra [[の]] or a である. The meaning is identical.
>ダブルブッキング==**の**ことがある==。  
>ダブルブッキング==**である**ことがある==。
>**Sometimes, there are** double bookings.

# with 〜ば
>[!from]
>[[ことがある]] → [[〜ば]] + [[ことがある]]

denotes that 'sometimes it happens that (...), but sometimes it happens that (...)'.
This is sort of similar to the [[ほど#The more (...), the more (...)]] expression.
>彼女は優しい==こともあれば==、怖い==こともある==。
>**Sometimes** my girlfriend is gentle, **but sometimes** she is scary

>本当==のこともあれば==、ウソ==のこともある==。
>Some things are true, some things are false.

# I have done/experience in (...)
Putting the verb into the [[〜た|Past tense]] emphasises that you have experienced something before- lit. "There are times when I have done (...)"
This is a very common set phrase, and for that reason many textbooks treat it as a separate grammar point.
>==聞いた==ことがある。
>I **have previously heard** of it

>こんな歌を==歌ったことがない==
>I **have never sung** a song like this **before**.

This is different from putting the ある in past tense, which emphasises that there were times when you did something (but you no longer do them).
>眠る==ことがあった==                                                   ↔  ==眠た==ことがある
>I used to sleep                                                         ↔  I have previously slept
>(there have been times when I was sleeping)    ↔  (I have experienced in sleeping)

And yes, they can be used together.
>==眠た==ことが==あった==
I once fell asleep (There have been times where I have slept)

Denoting the time until you have (not) done something is with [[まで]]＋[[に]]
>==二十歳までに==足を怪我==したことがなかった==
>I **had never** injured my leg **before I was 20**

>==最近まで==海外に==行ったことがなかった==
>**Up until recently**, **I had never gone** abroad.
