# Transitivity
Using 〜てある with an intransitive verb does not make sense.
If the verb is transitive, the verb remains a transitive verb, but the focus can shift to the object.  
を->が
"Who does it" (original が) drops out.
>橋==を==開く
>I Open the bridge (transitive form of verb)

>橋==が==開い==てある==
>The bridge has been opened (transitive form of verb)

The てある form of a transitive verb can use either the が or the を particle, depending on the focus. が puts focus on the thing that is made, whereas を puts focus on the maker.

>寿司とサラダ==を==作ってあります。
>**I** made sushi and salad.

>寿司とサラダ==が==作ってあります。
>**Sushi and salad** are made.
