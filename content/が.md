# subject
# Object of emotion
Where you'd consider a word transitive in Fnglish, if it is about emotion you consider something an object of emotion. This is also why so many 形容詞 exist that English uses verbs for.
>私はお父さん~~を~~心配です。
>私はお父さん==が==心配です。
>I am worried **about** my father

>野菜が好きです
>I like vegetables.

# Object of potential
When using **_adjectives_** that describe _**potential**_ such as 苦手 = "bad at (...)" or 下手 = "unskilled in", you use the particle 「が」to express the object of potential
>私が数学==が苦手==です
>I'm bad at mathematics.

>私は日本語==が上手い==外国人です
>I'm a foreigner (who is) good at japanese.

This is not the case when it's related to attitude and eligibility: then it goes with に  
e.g. attitude 
- 新設
- 丁寧
- 厳しい
- 冷たい

Eligibility
- 強い (strong againts ...)

# But
See [[けど・が|が]].
indicates a contradiction; 'but'. same meaning as [[けど・が|けど]]. It is a literary variant, and is more #formal however.
>デパートに行きました==が==、何も欲しくなかったです
>I went to the department store, but there was nothing I wanted.
