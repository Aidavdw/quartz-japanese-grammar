Should not be confused with the [[volitional form (〜oう)]], which conjugates to 〜よう for 一段 verbs, e.g. 食べよう = let's eat.

# "In order to do (...)"
when combined with the particle [[に]], it shows a requirement.
denotes that an actions is taken in order to get closer to an objective.  
It's like 'for the purpose of', 'for the sake of', 'in order to'  
ように is used when there is no freedom of decision, [[ため]]に is used when someone can choose.
> 風邪を引かない==ように==、暖かい服装をする。
> So that I don't catch a cold, I wear warm clothes.

>約束の時間に==間に合うように==、急いで行きます。
>**In order to** be in time for the appointment, I will hurry.

[[ために vs ように]]


# (...)-like
it can also be used to describe that something is like another. This is when it is #noun＋ , going with a [[の]] particle.

>He is **just like** you.

>ヨーダは==宇宙人のよう==だ。
>Yoda **appears to be like** an alien

>==魚のように==泳ぐ

## ようにする
combining with [[する]] is a very often used construction to indicate that you will 'make it to be a certain way'.

>I was told to study daily.

>本を==買うように==頼まれた
>I was requested to buy that book.
# It seems that (...)
it can also be used to denote uncertain observations.
よう(だ) is usually based on direct information/experience, so they are **very confident**.
- 例え - Using (A) as an example to highlight the way that (B) looks/is acting.  
- 推定 - Using (A) as a reason for an assumption made about (B).  
- {例示|れいじ} - Presenting (A) as an example of what (B) is.

It goes directly #verb＋ and #形容詞＋ .
>ここに大きなビルが出来る==ようだ==。
>**It looks like** a big building will be built here.

>あそこのプールは深い==様だ==。
>That pool ==appears to be== deep.

#形容動詞＋, the な must still be used.

>In reality, he **seems** anxious.
