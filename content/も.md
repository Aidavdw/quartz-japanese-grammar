a [[Particle]]
# Also, even
## With question word
When combined with a [[Question word]], も as a contrast indicator goes with the negative
>==誰も==知らない
>I don't know **anyone**.

>==何も==嬉しくない
>I am not glad about **anything**

>==どっちも==食べません
>I won't eat both of them

An odd one is いつも, which just becomes 'always', not going with the negative
>==いつも==そばにいる
>To always be at your side
# Adverbial

# A surprising amount
this particle after a counter implies surprise.
>==三時間も==話した
>We talked **a surprising 3 hours**

> 本を==１００ページも==読みました
> I read **a surprising 100 pages** of the book

When used with a negative, it has more of a nuance of 'not even (...)', with disappointment.
>==１０人も==学校に**来なかった**
>==Not even 10 people== came to school

# Contrast


# In between verbs?
putting a focus particle like も in-between a verb puts emphasis on the verb.
I think this is literally just taking the [[連用中止法 (i-stem)|i-stem]], も, and [[する]] in the [[negative form (〜ない)]].
>彼は本を==読みもしない==
>He won't _even_ read the book (not doing any activities, not even this one!)
