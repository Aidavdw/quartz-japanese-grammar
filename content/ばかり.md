has a word that gives the nuance that "you do it so much that everything else sort of pales in comparison". It has a negative connotation, meaning it's always a bad thing.

>毎日テレビ==ばかり==見ている。
>Watching television (it is about the only thing you do, you lazy slob).

ヒトリエ uses this word so much in their songs lol. カラノワレモノ
>どうしようもない言葉==ばかりだ==
>It's just useless words
# So much, everything else pales in comparison
it means something keeps going further and further in a **negative** connotation- It becomes worse and worse. This is more by convention, and not a true grammatical rule however.  
In this regard it's different from [[一方]]だ, which can be either positive or negative. 
## ばかりだ
Used with [[copula (だ・です)]]
>ガソリンの値段は==上がっていくばかりだ==。
>The price of gas **keeps on** rising.

>日本の人口は==減るばかりです==。
>Japan's population keeps on **becoming lower and lower**.

>最近は全然体を鍛えてないから、筋肉が==無くなっていくばかりだ==。
>Because I have not been exercising my body lately, muscle **keeps on** disappearing.

>観光客が==減るばかりで==、周りの店が潰れていっている
>The amount of tourist keeps on decreasing, so stores around here are closing

## ばかりで
Similarly, can be used with [[〜て#and (...)]] (ばかり is a noun, so the 〜て conjugates to で) to denote something is *just doing (...) and hardly anything else.*
>夏は==暑いばかりで==、楽しくないですよ
>Summer is **just hot, and hardly anything else**. it's not enjoyable.

>うちの子は毎日==遊んでるばかりで==勉強をしない。
>My kid **only plays all day, and hardly anything else** and never studies.

>この仕事は==忙しいばかりで==、意味がない。
>This job is **just busy, and doesn't have much else to it**. There is no meaning to it.
## ばかりに
Also usable with [[に#into (...)]] to denote that*B only happens because A happens a lot*. A bit like [[から]], but only because of one aspect.
>==背が高いばかりに==、写真を撮った。
>**Just because I am tall**, they took pictures.

>==ボールを投げたばかりに==、肩が外れました。
>**Just by throwing a ball**, I dislocated my shoulder.

>彼は練習が==大変なばかりに==、辞めました。
>Because the training was **only heavy (and not much else**), he quit.
# Just started doing (...)
>日本語を==勉強して始めたばかり==の大学生ですので、先にひらがなとカタカナを覚えるべきです。
>A university student who is **just starting to learn** japanese should learn hirgana and katakana first.

# Recently finished doing (...)
[[〜た]] + ばっかり
Like "Lately, all I have been doing is (...)". The part where you are now no longer doing it eludes me, but I think it is in the past tense.

>きっと名前を==聞いたばかり==なのに、忘れちゃった。
>even though I have recently (finished) heard heard his/her name, I forgot it.

>結婚==したばかり==です。
>I recently got married.  

>日本へ==来たばかり==の時、日本語が話せなくて困りました。
>in the time that I had only recently (finished to) come to Japan, I did not speak japanese and had a hard time.
# In-between ている
When used with a [[〜ている]] form, ばかり is often placed in-between.
>友達と==遊んでばかりいる==
>All I do is playing with friends.
