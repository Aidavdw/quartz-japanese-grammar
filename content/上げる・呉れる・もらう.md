are all verbs related to 'giving' (あげる、くれる) or receiving (もらう) things or favours.
You use the [[に]] particle to show to whom it goes.

# Humble variants
もらう　→　{頂|いただく}く
# Your 'circle' - Which to use?
You use くれる when it is done **towards you(r circle)**
You use あげる when it is done **outwards of your circle** or **outside of your circle**.
You use もらう to denote **receiving**, regardless of circle.

>お母さんはノートを**Aさんに**==あげた==。
>Aさんはノートを**お母さんに**==くれた==
>お母さんはノートを**私に**==くれた==
>私はノートを**Aさんに**==もらった==。
>Aはノートを**私から**==もらった==。

# に・から for もらう
For もらう, both [[に]] and [[から]] can be used to denote the giver. から is preferred if に makes it ambiguous!
>==彼から==花を==もらう==
>==彼に==花を==もらう==
>to receive flowers from a boyfriend.
# Volitional only
These words are all [[Volition|volitional]], meaning that if something goes against someone's will, or it makes someone unhappy, you *cannot* use these words.
>先生が宿しゅく題だいをたくさん~~くれた~~。
>先生が宿しゅく題だいをたくさん==出だした==。

>履歴書を~~あげた~~
>履歴書を==渡わたした==
>I handed over my CV **(I had to, it's not like I wanted to)**

# もらう when you put in effort
When you go out of your way to get something, use もらう and not くれる
>種類が市役所に~~くれた~~
>種類が市役所に==もらった==
>I got the documents at the municipal office
>(They don't just give them to you, you have to ask them)

Also for [[上げる・呉れる・もらう#Request]], もらう can imply that you have specifically requested something
>助手にかばんを==買ってくれた==。　○
>助手にかばんを==買ってもらった==。　○
>My assistant bought this bag for me.

>助手にかばんを~~買ってくれた~~。　✕
>助手にかばんを==買ってもらった==。○
>I got my assistent to buy this bag for me.
# As auxiliary verbs
As auxiliary verbs, they have to do with asking for a favour or being thankful for having received a favour. Like the circles concept, it depends on whose perspective you see it from.

>弟が本を貸し==てくれた== 
>I borrowed my little brothers book **(he did me a favour, and I am thankful)**

>子供にケーキを買っ==てあげた ==
>I bought cake for my kid **(as a favour)**

Note that this is what is 「～ください」in 敬語！
>教えて==ください==
>Please tell me!
## Request
When in a question, it is a request. This is very commonly done in the [[Potential form (〜eる)]]
>手伝っ==てくれますか==？
>Can you help me?

>ビールを==買ってもらえますか==？
>Could you buy a beer for me?
### really polite
You can make it even more polite by putting it in the negative
>駅まで来==てくれませんか==?
>Couldn't you please come to the station?

Can also use the [[謙譲語 (Humble language)]] variants:
>会議に出席して==いただけません==か？
>Could I perhaps join the meeting?

# Indirectness
As per usual in Japanese, being indirect is more polite. Prefer くれる over あげる (especially when the other person is higher in status)
>先生に本を貸し~~てあげました~~
>先生が本を貸し==てもらった==

# With causative
When combined with [[Causative form (〜aせる)]], denotes that someone allowed you to do something (lit. To let someone receive the favour of (...))
>上司が==休ませてもらった==。
>My boss allowed to take some time off.

When very using [[謙譲語 (Humble language)]], it is just 'doing' the thing
>本を==読ませてもらいます==。
>I read the book (humble)

>明日==休ませていただけませんか==。
>lit. Wouldn't you let me humbly receive the favour of taking tomorrow off?
