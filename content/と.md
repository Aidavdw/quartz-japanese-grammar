a [[Particle]]
# Together with (...), partner
>**友達**==と==遊ぶ
>Playing **(together) with** friends

More formal way would be to use {共|とも}に

# Two-way comparison
>絵==と==比べる
>Comparing paintings

>父は息子==と==似ている
>The father looks a lot **like** the kid.

# Quotation
Nomimalises the part that comes before it, essentially turning it into a 'quote'
>==行かないでと==言った
>He said "don't go".

>==彼が引っ越すと==聞いた
>I heard **that** he will move.

>==資産がありませんと==説明した
>He explained **that** there is no budget.

# And (...)
between two nouns
>リンゴ==と==スイカ
>Apples **and** watermelons

# Conditional
100% certainty. More certain than 〜たら.
Therefore, it's more like 'when' than 'if'.
**“when X happens, Y happens”**. Y is predictable or an unavoidable fact, or a natural consequence.
1. “when you turn, there will be a bank”.
2. “when I opened the door, snow came in”.

>四月に==なると==、桜が咲さく
>**When** it becomes april, the cherry blossoms **will** bloom.

>==先生だと==、きっと年上なんじゃないですか。
>**If** he's a teacher, **it has to be the case that** he is older (than us), right?

>今==出かけないと==遅れるよ。
>**If** you don't depart now, you **will** be late

>学校に==行かないと==、友達と会えないよ
>If you don't go to school, then you won't meet any friends.

the だと is an often-used stylistic figure.
>==これだと==乗り換えなし
>If _this_ is the case, you don't have to transfer (trains)

>==愛だと==運命です。
>If love is what it is, it must be fate.

Less intuitive, but it shows just that two events are related: it is only when you went to the hospital that you saw Fujiwara-san. It is similar to [[時に]] in this context.
>病院に行く==と=={藤原|ふじわら}さんがいました。
>When I went to the hospital, I saw fujiwara-san.

Must always be follow by **non-past tense**.
>窓を~~開た~~と、牛が~~見えてきました~~。
