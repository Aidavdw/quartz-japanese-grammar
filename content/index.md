Welcome to my Japanese grammar notes!
This is a collection of tidbits, interesting things, and short explanations and comparisons between different grammar concepts in the japanese language. It is mostly sourced from Tae Kim, imabi, bunpro, jlptsensei, things I found on ja.hinative.com, and random YouTube videos.
This is not really super beginner stuff nor is it super exhaustive, mostly consisting of more intermediate notes. For the basics I would really recommend [Tae Kim's book](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Japanese-Grammar-approach-learning/dp/1495238962) or [his website](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/)!
99% of it is in English, but you might find a couple explanations or transliterations in Japanese or Dutch.

# Categorisation
Instead of a folder structure, this overview uses a tag system to denote specific characteristics of a grammar point:
- #composite depicts a grammar point that is made up of two other grammar points. These will always link back to what they were made from.
-  #auxiliary-verb denotes that this is a verb that can be directly appended to another verb or [[形容詞 (i-adjective)]].
- #grammar-concept is a (rough collection) of idea(s) that has no exact set pattern.
- #grammar-word is a specific word that has a fixed meaning when used in a sentence, or is used to make specific constructions.
- #guide explains how to do a very specific thing in Japanese, usually step-by-step!
- #multiple-different-meanings means that this is a grammar point that has multiple very different uses or interpretations.
- #multi means that this page contains several very closely related but still separate points. This is usually clarified with the aliases of the page.
- #old means it's very ye olde fashion Japanese
- #sub contains a point that is actually a sub-point of another grammar point, but it is big or complex enough to have its own page.
- #vs shows how two different grammar points relate: How are they different, and how are they the same?

## How to add it in a sentence?
Some grammar concepts are limited to use only with specific words or sentence structures
- #sentence-ending denotes that this is a sentence ending particle, or at least a word that always comes at the end of a sentence.
- #counter or #counter＋ is a grammar concept that goes together with a counter- usually meaning that it has to do with amounts.
- #transitive and #intransitive Say something about a verbs [[Transitivity]], or that this grammar pattern can only be used in a sentence pattern like this.
- #negative-only means that this grammar point can only be used in conjunction with a sentence or verb conjugated to the [[negative form (〜ない)]].
- #word-modifier means this word is directly added after another word to modify its meaning. According to most dictionaries, that would make it a new word.
If it can be added directly together with a specific type of word, one of the following is used. If a linking [[Particle]] is necessary, then it is indicated directly after the **＋**.
- Nouns: #noun＋  #noun＋な #noun＋の 
- After full sentences: #sent＋ 
- [[形容動詞 (な-adjective)]]: #形容動詞＋  #形容動詞＋な 
- [[形容詞 (i-adjective)]]: #形容詞＋ 

If adding this somehow requires you to change the actual word or do a conjugation, then this will be denoted with a **〜**
- Verbs: #verb〜 . If it has to be put in the [[〜た|Past tense]]: #verb〜た 
- [[形容詞 (i-adjective)]]: #形容詞〜  

## Speech Style & Register
Some concepts are only used or relevant in certain context or formalities.
- #casual is in casual conversation- use with your friends, not with your boss!
- #formal and #丁寧語 is language you would use with your boss. You still can use it with your friends, but don't overdo it or you might come across as too stiff!
- #尊敬語 is used when you want to be even more respectful. Use this to talk to your boss or to a client.
-  #謙譲語 is for humble language- showing that you are very thankful that people would even look in your direction let alone listen to you
- #slang denotes that this is what the cool kids use, yo.
- #rough is that even for guys this is really showing how cool you are. Think Yakuza type stuff.
- #childish pls don't talk like this too often. Mostly here because you often see it in media.
- #feminine is something most often used by women.
- #male is guy-ish speech. Usually a little more rough.
- #spoken-language Not really written
- #written-language Not really spoken, only in like writing.
