denotes your own desire to do something.
It can only be used for self, and not for what someone else wants.
>タクシーに==乗りたい==
>I want to take a taxi

>学校へ==行きたくない==
>I don't want to go to school

# becomes [[形容詞 (i-adjective)|形容詞]]
So it can be further conjugated.
>食べ==たく==なった
>I became wanting to eat.

# Can take object of emotion.
'wanting' fits the category of [[Describing emotions]], meaning it can take an object of emotion.
This means that what you want is not denoted with を, but with [[が#Object of emotion]].
An alternative reading of this is that it turns into a 形容詞, which means that it also becomes intransitive.

Choose something from options
>ご飯==が==食べたい。
>I want to eat rice.

Do a routine action
>今日は==バスケットボールがしたい==です
>Today, I want to play basketball.
# transitivity
Using a transitive verb in its たい form retains [[Transitivity]]. It allows to use either the が  or を particle to be used in the sub-sentence, depending on the thing you want to emphasise.

>魚==が==食べたい。
>The fish is something I want to eat.

>魚==を==食べたい。
>I want to eat fish
