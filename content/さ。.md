is a [[Sentence Ending Particle]].
It has the same meaning as [[よ。]], but it is very #casual  and #spoken-language . 

>あの==さ==
>Hey, uhh... 

>何もできなくて==さ==
>I wasn't able to do anything, **y'know**

Some people really tend to overuse this word as a filler word.
>ディズニーランドに行ったんだけど==さ==、なんか==さ==、凄い込んでて
>I went to Disneyland, **like**, and it was, **like**, really crowded.
