When sequencing actions (doing A after B)

～た[[後]]で implies that the actions are **independent**.
>仕事が終わっ==た後で==行く
>I will go **after** work
>lit. (***after** the work has ended, I will go*)

～て[[から]] implies **dependence**: v1 can only be done after v2 has been done.  
>仕事が終わっ==てから==行く
>I will go **after I finish** work (I cannot leave before work is finished.)
