# Conditional
It is best interpreted as “**if you are talking about…, then…**“, as it emphasises the topic.
Overall, [[なら(ば)]] is used to give **suggestions or advice, speculation, or requests** .

〜なら cannot go with the ます conjugation. 
>食べ~~ます~~なら
>食べるなら

Adding the [[〜ば]] makes it more #formal.
アリスさんが==言うならば==、問題ないよ。
**In the event that** Alice **says so**, then there is no problem.
## Advice or suggestion
>中国に行く==なら==、{万里|ばんり}の{長城|ちょうじょう}を見みてください。
>If you're saying you're going to china, please be sure to see the great wall!

>カメラを買いたい==なら==、秋葉原に行った方がいいです。
>If you're saying you want to buy a camera, you should go to Akihabara.

>いいえ、売り切れましたが、{自由席|じゆうせき}==なら==あります。
>No, they're sold out, **but if you would like** an unreserved seat instead, they are still available.

## if that is the case
it can be used very similarly to [[から]], except that it has a slightly more hypothetical vibe
>それ==なら==話は早い。
>If you're saying that is the case, then it should be nice and easy.

>==みんなが行くなら==、私も行く。
>**In the event that** everyone goes, then I will go too!

also very often used with a single thing; often names or pronouns. Emphasises that because it's this person, (...), similar to [[こそ]].
>悲鳴：こんな難しい宿題全然作り上げられないよ
>返事：==君なら==できる
>You can do it, because it's you!
>(lit. If it is you, you can do it)
## Request
>知っている==んなら==、教えてください。
>If you're saying you know it, please tell me!

## with explanatory の
used with the [[explanatory の・んだ]] , のなら・んなら is stronger and enforces a confirmation of the content of the condition.
>仕事を終えた==のなら==、帰っていいよ。
>If you're saying you have finished working, you can go home.
