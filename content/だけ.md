# Only
Denotes exclusiveness: "*only (...)*"
[[だけ]] is the antonym of [[しか]], but as しか can only be used in the negative, they are used similarly.

>==1時間だけ==寝た
>I only slept one hour.

>==お母さんにだけ==手紙を書いた
>I wrote a letter to only my mother

>==魚だけ==食べなかった
>I **only** did not eat fish

# As (...) as possible
when used with the [[Potential form (〜eる)]], it denotes that you do something to a degree of which you are able to do it. Fittingly sometimes referred to as the 可能型.
>ランドセルに荷物を==入れられるだけ==入れて、家出した。
>I **put as much** stuff into my randoseru (backpack) **as I could**, and left the house.

Very commonly used set phrase is できるだけ
>今日は息子の誕生日なので、==できるだけ==早く家に帰りたいです。
>Because today is my son's birthday, I want to go home **as soon as is possible**.

## As many/much as possible
when used with the [[〜たい]], or another verb that denotes wanting (好き、欲しい) denotes that you want to do something *as much as you want*, (usually unlimited, you glutton)
>日本に帰ったら、すしを==食べたいだけ==食べたい。
>When I get back to japan, I want to eat **as much** sushi **as I can possibly eat**.

>==好きなだけ==持って行ってください。
>Please take **as many as you like**.

# To try to do as well as one can
very similar to [[〜て見る]].
ダメかもしらないが、〜してみる.
Repeats the verb.
>合格できるかわからないけど、==受けるだけ受ける==ことにした。
>I don't know if I can pass but, **I will try to** take **as much of** the test as I can

>開いているわからないけど、==行くだけ行って==みよう.
>I don't know if it's still open, but I still want to try to go!
