a [[Particle]]
# Method or means
Using what, or how

>日本語==で==話してください。
>Please speak **using** Japanese

## Material
When expressing what material something is made from, で is used if the thing clearly looks like it's made from that material. [[から#Out of (...)]] is more suitable when you cannot visually judge what materials are used to make products.
>~~竹から~~弁当箱を作ります。
>==竹で==弁当箱を作ります。
>Making a bento box using/from bamboo.

>家を木==で==建てる
>Build a house **out of/using** wood.
# State
>==ふたりで==遊ぶ
> Playing together (**with** two people)

>==洋服で==東京に行く
>Going to Tokyo **in the state of using** western clothing

# Causation
similar to [[から]], but not as strong. Also ties into [[〜て#and (...)]].
>電車が雪==で==止まる
>Because of snow, the trains stop
