It is a way to connect two sub-clauses, enabling you to talk about about the first sub-clause in the second one.  

from [[と#Quotation]]+[[言う]]
It derives its meaning from 言う in that it talks about (と) "the thing called (...)".
>==人間という==生き物はバカだな
>The beings that are referred to as 'humans' are stupid.

>これは日本語で==なんと言う==言葉ですか？
>what is this word in Japanese? (lit. This word is what word in Japanese?)

It is often combined with either [[の#The "..." one]], [[の#Single instance of performing an action]] or [[こと#the act of doing (...)]]
>==日本人はお酒に弱いと言う**の**==は本当？
>**Japanese people being weak to alcohol**, is it true?

>==独身だと言うの==は、嘘だったの？
>**You being single**, is it a lie?

>リブート==と言うの==はパソコンを消えて、点けると==言うこと==です。
>**The thing that is called 'reboot'** is the act of "turning it off, and turning it on".

# It is said that (...)
When used with the [[〜ている]], or [[passive form (〜aれる)|passive]] (言われている) it implies it is currently still being said.
implies that a lot of people (in general) say so- it is a generally understood thing; "**It is said that**"
>日本語は難しい言語==と言っています==。
>It is **generally said** that Japanese is a hard language.

>ナットは体にいい==と言われています==
>Natto is **generally regarded as** a food that is good for your health.
