[[すら]] is identical.
# Negative: taking for granted not the case
In a sentence with [[negative form (〜ない)]], it shows that something taken for granted is not the case.
"not even close" to show that not even the minimum expectation has been met.
>宿題が多すぎて、トイレに行く時間==さえなかった==
>There was so much homework, I didn't **even** have time to go to the toilet.
>(You'd think you would have time to go to the toilet right?)

>お弁当を買うお金==さえなかった==。
>I didn't even have money to buy lunch...

A sentence that combines the negative and the 〜ば shows that the negative meaning takes precedence.
>自分の過ちを==認めさえしなければ==、問題は解決しないよ。
>The problem won't be solved if you don't even acknowledge your own mistakes, you know.
# さえ〜ば
For sentences that are not in the negative, it can also be like 'that's all you need to get there! Nothing more!'
Almost all of these sentences I have found use this together with さえ(...)[[〜ば]]. 
I think this might mean that it requires this structure for a positive sentence?
>お金さえ==あれば==、何でもできるよ。
>As long as you have got money, you can do everything!

>そんなにほっておいて==さえいたら==、直ぐ直るよ。
>You **just** have to leave it like that, and then it will settle itself!

It is #verb〜 , taking the [[連用中止法 (i-stem)|i-stem]].
>ビタミンを==**食べ**さえすれば==、健康が保証されますよ。

# で
Add a [[で]] to #noun＋ to make it sound more empathetic. Purely stylistic.
>==天才でさえ==出来ないのに、あなたが出来るわけがないでしょう
>If **even a genius** can't do it, there is no way you can do it.

>==私でさえ==出来れば、あんたには楽ちんでしょう。
>If even I can do it, it should be a breeze for you.
