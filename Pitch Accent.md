Japanese has a tonal system. Depending on how you change the pitch, you can change the meaning of a word. There are 4 main patterns:

|                                     | 平板   | 頭高   | 中高   | 尾高   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Starts                              | low  | high | low  | low  |
| Center is                           | high | low  | high | high |
| Word ends                           | high | low  | low  | high |
| particle is                         | high | low  | low  | low  |
| One letter words                    | ○    | ✕    | ✕    | ○    |
| particle accent in one-letter words |      |      |      |      |
tl:dr: 
- 平板↔頭高
- 中高 = 尾高 where pitch drops somewhere in middle of word.
- single mora 尾高 is high-low
# 平板
{平板|へいばん} is the 'accentless', flat-ish profile.
About 70% of all japanese words are heiban.
The first mora is low, all following are high.
The particle following is also high.

# 頭高
{頭高|あたまだか} is the 'head high' pattern.
The first mora is high, all following are low.
The particle is also low.
It is the exact opposite of the 平板.

# 中高
{中高|なかだか} has the middle high.
The first mora is low. The pitch rises after, but it drops again somewhere in the word.
The particle is low.

# 尾高
{尾高|おだか} has the tail high
The first mora is low, except if the word only has a single mora. For single mora, it is identical to 頭高
The pitch rises after the first mora.
At the particle, the pitch drops again.
