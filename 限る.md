The literal meaning of the [[Auxiliary verb]] {限|かぎ}る is 「境を付ける」 *'to set a boundary'.* This means that [[に]] marks the location (or situation), within which the speaker then states as being 'the boundary'. 

# (...) とは限らない
means that **it doesn't always hold that (...); it isn't always the case that (...)**: something isn't necessarily always true (when drawing conclusions).  
It comes from [[と#Quotation]] + 限る, in that "it is not limited to (...)"
Often goes hand in hand with the て-form + も, giving the nuance of "not even when (...)". 
>日が**出っても**暖かい==とは限らない==。
>Even if the sun is out, **it isn't necessarily the case that** it is warm.

>日本に２年間住んでいるからと言って、日本語を話せる==とは限らない==。
>Saying that a person has lived in japan for 2 years, it doesn't always hold that they can speak Japanese.

For #形容動詞＋ , it turns into でも. It also needs to have a だ in front.
>田舎**でも**静か==だとは限らない==。
>even if a place is rural, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is tranquil.
