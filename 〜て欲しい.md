When you want someone else to do something, do not use [[〜たい]]. That is not allowed due to [[Volition]]. You can express that you want someone to do by 'wishing' however.
>[!form]
>[[〜て]] + 欲しい

>食べて==ほしい==
>I want you to eat this.

The resulting form is still a [[形容詞 (i-adjective)]], so it can be conjugated
>行って==ほしくなかった==
>I did not want you to go.

# Who?
With [[に]] you can specify whom you want to do something
>私は子==供に==もっと==勉強して欲しい==
>I want the child to study more.

>昨日は==あなたに==早く==来てほしかった==
>Yesterday, I wanted you to come early.

# Negative
Can put negatives in two places. Remember kids, putting the 'no' first puts the person second!
>食べて欲しく==ない==
>I don't want you to eat it (weaker)

>食べ==ない==で欲しい
>I want you to not eat it (much more assertive)
